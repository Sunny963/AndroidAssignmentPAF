# APF

# install latest android studio IDE

# just clone this repository and fetch code

# simply run the code by clicking play button at the middle top of the IDE

# By default UI will run in compose view

# To run UI using XML view please pass isComposeView as false in loadImages

# We have Coil's built-in disk caching mechanism. Coil automatically caches images to disk by default, so no need to explicitly manage the disk cache
